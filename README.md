# Open Wearables React Native SDK

The official React Native SDK for the [Open Wearables](https://github.com/the-momentum/open-wearables) project.

The SDK is built with the [Expo Module API](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/module-api/) enabling install the app in Expo Project as well as in React Native CLI projects.
It is a wrapper for the native iOS and Android SDKs to allow React Native apps to collect and sync health data.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status                                                                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS      | Implemented (bundled Rhise native SDK, requires iOS 15.1+)                    |
| Android  | Implemented (via Maven Local dependency `com.openwearables.health:sdk:0.11.2`) |

## Migration from 0.2.0–0.2.2

`syncNow()` is available again. Versions 0.2.0–0.2.2 removed it because the native foreground
observer was assumed to start a fresh sync, but it only resumed interrupted sessions. Call
`await OpenWearablesHealthSDK.syncNow()` when the app enters the foreground to fetch new Apple
Health changes immediately. The iOS implementation uses persisted anchors; it resumes an
unfinished initial export without downgrading it and remains single-flight.

`resumeSync()` remains separate: it only does anything when a resumable sync session exists and is
unrelated to triggering a fresh incremental round.

`getSyncStatus()` is now typed as [`SyncStatus`](#getsyncstatus-syncstatus) instead of
`Record<string, any>`, and gained two fields: `initialExportDone` and `isSyncing`.

`getStoredCredentials()` is now typed as [`StoredCredentials`](#getstoredcredentials-storedcredentials)
instead of `Record<string, any>`, and returns the same eight keys on both platforms.

`resumeSync()` now resolves `false` uniformly when there is nothing to resume. It previously
rejected with `No resumable sync session` on Android while iOS resolved `false`.

## Platform differences

The JS API is identical on both platforms, but two calls cannot behave identically because the
underlying native SDKs differ:

| API | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setSyncInterval(minutes)` | **No-op.** The iOS SDK has no sync-interval API; the system schedules background delivery itself. | Honoured, but floored at 15 minutes by WorkManager. |
| `configure(host, customSyncURL)` | `customSyncURL` is **ignored** — the iOS SDK's `configure(host:)` accepts no such parameter, and `getStoredCredentials().customSyncUrl` is therefore always `null`. | Both arguments are honoured and reflected in `getStoredCredentials()`. |

`getAvailableProviders()` returns a single `apple` / "Apple Health" entry on iOS, and the installed
provider(s) (`google`, `samsung`) on Android. Accordingly `setProvider("apple")` resolves `true` on
iOS and any other id resolves `false`.

## Installation

Currently, the SDK is only available locally. You can install it using the following command from the project root folder:

```sh
npm install
```

When we publish the package to npm, we will use the following command (not available yet):

```sh
npm install open-wearables
```

Then, depending if you are using Expo or React Native CLI, follow the instructions below:

### Expo

Expo projects using the Expo Modules API automatically link native dependencies.
The reviewed Rhise iOS SDK is included in this package, so applications must not add a separate
`OpenWearablesHealthSDK` CocoaPod or Expo Podfile override.

After installing the package, simply run your project.

```sh
npx expo run:ios
```

If your project does not yet contain native directories (ios/ and android/), Expo will automatically generate them.

You can also generate them manually using:

```sh
npx expo prebuild
```

### React Native CLI

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have **[installed and configured the expo package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/)** before continuing.

After installing the package, install the iOS CocoaPods dependencies:

```sh
npx pod-install
```

or manually:

```sh
cd ios && pod install
```

The RN pod compiles the vendored native iOS sources directly; no additional native SDK dependency
or CocoaPods source is required.

### Android (temporary setup)

The Android implementation currently relies on a local Maven dependency:

```
implementation("com.openwearables.health:sdk:0.11.2")
```

To test the Android integration using `mavenLocal`, please refer to the setup instructions in the example app:

👉 **[example/README.md](./example/README.md)**

## Config Plugin (optional)

You can customize the permission messages displayed to users by configuring the plugin in your app.json or app.config.js.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "open-wearables",
        {
          "healthShareUsage": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to read your health data.",
          "healthUpdateUsage": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to write health data."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

| **Option**        | **Description**                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| healthShareUsage  | Sets the NSHealthShareUsageDescription value in Info.plist.  |
| healthUpdateUsage | Sets the NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription value in Info.plist. |

## Example app

A minimal Expo application demonstrating how to integrate the SDK.

See the example project:  
👉 **[example/README.md](./example/README.md)**

## Usage

```ts
import OpenWearablesHealthSDK from "open-wearables";

// Configure the SDK with your backend host
OpenWearablesHealthSDK.configure("https://your-api-host.com");

// Sign in (token-based)
OpenWearablesHealthSDK.signIn(userId, accessToken, refreshToken, null);

// Or sign in (API key)
OpenWearablesHealthSDK.signIn(userId, null, null, apiKey);

// Request HealthKit authorization
await OpenWearablesHealthSDK.requestAuthorization([
  "steps",
  "heartRate",
  "sleep",
]);

// Start background sync
await OpenWearablesHealthSDK.startBackgroundSync();

// Fetch Apple Health changes immediately when the app enters the foreground
await OpenWearablesHealthSDK.syncNow();
```

## API

### Configuration

#### `configure(host: string): void`

Sets the backend host URL for the SDK.

---

### Auth

#### `signIn(userId, accessToken, refreshToken, apiKey): void`

Signs in a user. `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, and `apiKey` are optional.

#### `signOut(): void`

Signs out the current user.

#### `updateTokens(accessToken: string, refreshToken: string | null): void`

Updates the stored auth tokens.

#### `restoreSession(): string | null`

Attempts to restore a previously saved session. Synchronous — returns the restored user id, or
`null` when there is no session to restore.

#### `isSessionValid(): boolean`

Returns whether the current session is valid.

---

### HealthKit Authorization

#### `requestAuthorization(types: HealthDataType[]): Promise<boolean>`

Requests HealthKit read permissions for the given data types. Returns `true` if the authorization was granted.

See `[HealthDataType](#healthdatatype)` for the full list of supported types.

---

### Sync

#### `startBackgroundSync(syncDaysBack?: number): Promise<boolean>`

Starts background health data sync, optionally limiting how many days back to sync. Resolves `true`
if started successfully, and `false` when it could not start — most commonly because the SDK is not
configured or no user is signed in. It resolves `false` rather than rejecting on both platforms.

> **Widening the range needs `resetAnchors()` first.** Query anchors survive `stopBackgroundSync()`,
> and neither native SDK compares the new `syncDaysBack` against the previous one. After a first
> sync completes, a restart with a larger `syncDaysBack` (or `undefined`) takes the incremental
> path and **will not backfill the newly-included older days** — on iOS because the stored
> `HKQueryAnchor` is a position in HealthKit's global change log, on Android because the incremental
> cursor is `max(storedAnchor, newFloor)`. Narrowing the range needs no reset.
>
> Call [`resetAnchors()`](#resetanchors-void) **while sync is stopped**, then start:
>
> ```ts
> await OpenWearablesHealthSDK.stopBackgroundSync();
> OpenWearablesHealthSDK.resetAnchors();
> await OpenWearablesHealthSDK.startBackgroundSync(30);
> ```
>
> Resetting *after* `startBackgroundSync` also eventually works, but the immediate full export it
> tries to trigger is dropped by the SDKs' "sync already in progress" guard, so the backfill is
> deferred to the next background trigger — and clearing the session and outbox mid-flight can drop
> batches that were pending upload.

#### `stopBackgroundSync(): void`

Stops background sync.

#### `syncNow(): Promise<void>`

Triggers a fresh anchor-based incremental sync on iOS. If the initial historical export is still
pending, it safely resumes in full-export mode; concurrent triggers are coalesced by the native
single-flight guard. On Android this resolves without starting extra work because the Android SDK
already receives the foreground lifecycle through `onForeground()`.

#### `syncRecentWindow(sinceMillis: number, types?: HealthDataType[]): Promise<boolean>`

Re-reads Apple Health samples whose start date is at or after the Unix epoch timestamp in
`sinceMillis`, then enqueues them through the native iOS SDK. Pass `types` to limit the catch-up to
a subset of health data types. This does not move the normal incremental-sync anchors, so a small
overlap is safe when the backend upserts duplicate samples.

This is a Rhise iOS extension. On Android the bridge deliberately resolves `true` without starting
work, so shared application code can call it without a platform branch.

#### `resumeSync(): Promise<boolean>`

Resumes an interrupted sync session, continuing from the records already sent. Resolves `false` when
there is no resumable session (on both platforms — see [Migration to 0.2.0](#migration-to-020)).

Both native SDKs already resume automatically when the app returns to the foreground, so this is a
manual retry rather than the primary mechanism — useful when a resume ran and died again while the
app stayed foregrounded.

Do **not** treat the resolved value as "a sync started": calling it while a round is already in
flight is safe but still resolves `true` having done nothing. Poll `getSyncStatus().isSyncing`
instead. On iOS the promise only settles once the whole round finishes, which can take minutes.

Gate any "resume" affordance on `!isSyncing && hasResumableSession` — `hasResumableSession` stays
`true` for the duration of an active round, so on its own it does not mean sync is stalled.

#### `isSyncActive(): boolean`

Returns whether background sync is currently active.

#### `getSyncStatus(): SyncStatus`

Returns the current sync status. Synchronous — no `await` needed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hasResumableSession` | `boolean` | Whether an interrupted sync session can be resumed. |
| `sentCount` | `number` | Number of records sent in the current session. |
| `completedTypes` | `number` | How many health data types have finished exporting. |
| `isFullExport` | `boolean` | Whether the current session is a full historical export. |
| `initialExportDone` | `boolean` | `false` while the initial full historical export is still pending or in progress. |
| `isSyncing` | `boolean` | `true` while a sync round is currently in flight. |
| `createdAt` | `string \| null` | ISO8601 timestamp of the current sync session, or `null` when there is none. |
| `uploadedChunks` | `number \| undefined` | Successful upload chunks in the current resumable session (iOS native SDK). |
| `uploadedRecords` | `number \| undefined` | Serialized payload entries successfully uploaded (iOS native SDK). |
| `uploadedBytes` | `number \| undefined` | Encoded JSON bytes successfully uploaded (iOS native SDK). |
| `queuedChunks` | `number \| undefined` | Chunks currently persisted in the upload outbox (iOS native SDK). |
| `queuedRecords` | `number \| undefined` | Serialized payload entries currently persisted in the outbox (iOS native SDK). |
| `queuedBytes` | `number \| undefined` | Encoded JSON bytes currently persisted in the outbox (iOS native SDK). |
| `hasPermanentFailure` | `boolean \| undefined` | Whether iOS stopped after a non-retryable upload response. |
| `permanentFailureStatusCode` | `number \| null \| undefined` | Terminal iOS HTTP status, `null` when no permanent failure exists. |

While `initialExportDone === false`, the historical backfill has not finished — prompt the user
to keep the app open so the export can complete.

The upload and outbox counters are optional because Android SDK `0.11.2` does not expose equivalent
diagnostics. `sentCount` remains the cross-platform health-sample progress counter; on iOS,
`uploadedRecords` counts serialized payload entries instead and can therefore differ.

When `hasPermanentFailure` is `true`, the iOS SDK received a terminal 4xx response, removed that
outbox item, and stopped without advancing sync progress. Automatic resume stays blocked until the
native sync state is explicitly cleared or reset; surface the status instead of offering a normal
retry loop.

#### `resetAnchors(): void`

Resets the query anchors, forcing a full re-sync on the next run. Synchronous — no `await` needed.

Two things to know before calling it:

- **The overlapping window is re-uploaded.** The next run re-fetches everything inside the current
  `syncDaysBack` range, including records already sent. There is no client-side dedup — the SDKs
  expect the backend to deduplicate.
- **Call it while sync is stopped.** If sync is still active, `resetAnchors()` immediately kicks off
  a full export using the *currently persisted* `syncDaysBack`, which is only updated inside
  `startBackgroundSync`.

See the note under [`startBackgroundSync`](#startbackgroundsyncsyncdaysback-number-promiseboolean)
for when a reset is required.

#### `getStoredCredentials(): StoredCredentials`

Returns the credentials currently stored by the SDK. Synchronous — no `await` needed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userId` | `string \| null` | The signed-in user id. |
| `accessToken` | `string \| null` | Stored access token. |
| `refreshToken` | `string \| null` | Stored refresh token. |
| `apiKey` | `string \| null` | Stored API key. |
| `host` | `string \| null` | Backend host passed to `configure()`. |
| `customSyncUrl` | `string \| null` | Custom sync URL. **Always `null` on iOS** — see [Platform differences](#platform-differences). |
| `isSyncActive` | `boolean` | Whether background sync is currently active. |
| `provider` | `string \| null` | `"apple"` on iOS; `"google"` or `"samsung"` on Android; `null` when none is selected. |

);

const authSub = OpenWearablesHealthSDK.addListener(
  "onAuthError",
  ({ statusCode, message }) => {
    console.error(`Auth error ${statusCode}:`, message);
  }
);

// Clean up
subscription.remove();
authSub.remove();
